# VRCOSC Docs
Welcome to VRCOSC's Docs. Here you can find the documentation on how to use the app, official modules, and making your own modules to distribute in the app.
Feel free to reach out on the Discord server if you need anymore guidance, or feel that parts of these docs aren't as well-written as they could be.

These docs are currently under construction, so some information may be wrong or missing.
