# Player
You can interact with the player by calling `VRChatClient.Player`. This contains the current value of all the player parameters (if available, otherwise null).

This also allows you to call a variety of methods that contribute to VRChat's input addresses to let you move the player, mute/unmute the microphone, etc...
